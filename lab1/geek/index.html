              Inside the computer’s world, there is only data. You can read
              data, modify data, create new data—but that which isn’t data
              cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of
              bits and is thus fundamentally alike. Bits are any kind of
              two-valued things, usually described as zeros and ones. Inside the
              computer, they take forms such as a high or low electrical charge,
              a strong or weak signal, or a shiny or dull spot on the surface of
              a CD. Any piece of discrete information can be reduced to a
              sequence of zeros and ones and thus represented in bits. For
              example, we can express the number 13 in bits. It works the same
              way as a decimal number, but instead of 10 different digits, you
              have only 2, and the weight of each increases by a factor of 2
              from right to left. Here are the bits that make up the number 13,
              with the weights of the digits shown below them:
            </p>
            <table class="table">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>0</td>
                  <td>0</td>
                  <td>0</td>
                  <td>0</td>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td>0</td>
                  <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>128</td>
                    <td>64</td>
                    <td>32</td>
                    <td>16</td>
                    <td>8</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                  </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
              So that’s the binary number 00001101. Its non-zero digits stand
              for 8, 4, and 1, and add up to 13.

              Imagine a sea of bits—an ocean of them. A typical modern computer
              has more than 30 billion bits in its volatile data storage
              (working memory). Nonvolatile storage (the hard disk or
              equivalent) tends to have yet a few orders of magnitude more. To
              be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost,
              we must separate them into chunks that represent pieces of
              information. In a JavaScript environment, those chunks are called
              values. Though all values are made of bits, 10 they play different
              roles. Every value has a type that determines its role. Some
              values are numbers, some values are pieces of text, some values
              are functions, and so on. To create a value, you must merely
              invoke its name. This is convenient. You don’t have to gather
              building material for your values or pay for them. You just call
              for one, and whoosh, you have it. They are not really created from
              thin air, of course. Every value has to be stored somewhere, and
              if you want to use a gigantic amount of them at the same time, you
              might run out of memory. Fortunately, this is a problem only if
              you need them all simultaneously. As soon as you no longer use a
              value, it will dissipate, leaving behind its bits to be recycled
              as building material for the next generation of values. This
              chapter introduces the atomic elements of JavaScript programs,
              that is, the simple value types and the operators that can act on
              such values.
