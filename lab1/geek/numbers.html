            <h1>Numbers</h1>

                <div class="col-12 col-md-8">
                    <p>Values of the number type are, unsurprisingly, numeric values. In a JavaScript
                        program, they are written as follows:</p>
                    <p>13</p>


                    <p>Use that in a program, and it will cause the bit pattern for the number 13
                        to come into existence inside the computer’s memory.
                        JavaScript uses a fixed number of bits, 64 of them, to store a single number
                        value. There are only so many patterns you can make with 64 bits, which means
                        that the number of different numbers that can be represented is limited. With
                        N decimal digits, you can represent 10N numbers. Similarly, given 64 binary
                        digits, you can represent 264 different numbers, which is about 18 quintillion
                        (an 18 with 18 zeros after it). That’s a lot.
                        Computer memory used to be much smaller, and people tended to use groups
                        of 8 or 16 bits to represent their numbers. It was easy to accidentally overflow
                        such small numbers—to end up with a number that did not fit into the given
                        number of bits. Today, even computers that fit in your pocket have plenty of
                        memory, so you are free to use 64-bit chunks, and you need to worry about
                        overflow only when dealing with truly astronomical numbers.
                        Not all whole numbers less than 18 quintillion fit in a JavaScript number,
                        though. Those bits also store negative numbers, so one bit indicates the sign of
                        the number. A bigger issue is that nonwhole numbers must also be represented.
                        
                        To do this, some of the bits are used to store the position of the decimal point.
                        The actual maximum whole number that can be stored is more in the range of
                        9 quadrillion (15 zeros)—which is still pleasantly huge.
                        Fractional numbers are written by using a dot.</p>
                    <p>9.81</p>
                    <p>For very big or very small numbers, you may also use scientific notation by
                        adding an e (for exponent), followed by the exponent of the number.</p>
                        <p>2.998e8</p>

                    <p>That is 2.998 × 108 = 299,800,000.
                        Calculations with whole numbers (also called integers) smaller than the
                        aforementioned 9 quadrillion are guaranteed to always be precise. Unfortunately, calculations with fractional numbers are generally not. Just as π (pi)
                        cannot be precisely expressed by a finite number of decimal digits, many numbers lose some precision when only 64 bits are available to store them. This
                        is a shame, but it causes practical problems only in specific situations. The
                        important thing is to be aware of it and treat fractional digital numbers as
                        approximations, not as precise values.</p>
